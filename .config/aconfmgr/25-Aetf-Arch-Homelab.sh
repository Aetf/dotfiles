#   Mount and automount units for the EFI System Partition (ESP) are generated
#   on EFI systems. The ESP is mounted to /boot/ (except if an Extended Boot
#   Loader partition exists, see below), unless a mount point directory /efi/
#   exists, in which case it is mounted there. Since this generator creates an
#   automount unit, the mount will only be activated on-demand, when accessed.
#   On systems where /boot/ (or /efi/ if it exists) is an explicitly configured
#   mount (for example, listed in fstab(5)) or where the /boot/ (or /efi/) mount
#   point is non-empty, no mount units are generated.
