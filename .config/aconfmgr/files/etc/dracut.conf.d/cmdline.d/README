This folder has no use in booted OS environment.
It is used by dracut-install-uki to collect them
and pass to dracut for use in building unified
kernel images.

In /etc/dracut.conf.d/defaults.conf, hostonly-cmdline
must be disabled to not let dracut automatically
detect kernel command line.

Note that dracut-install-uki builds two version of the kernel image:
1) a normal image that includes
    - `/etc/dracut.conf.d/cmdline.d/*.conf`
    - `/etc/dracut.conf.d/cmdline.d/normal/*.conf`
2) a fallback image that includes
    - `/etc/dracut.conf.d/cmdline.d/*.conf`
    - `/etc/dracut.conf.d/cmdline.d/fallback/*.conf`
